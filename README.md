This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General description

The web app is a user side of a smart house app.
The main page displays the rooms in the house.
Each room may hold up to 5 smart devices(Air conditor,Lights,Stereo,Water heater) under the following restrictions (and only them):
* each room has at most 1 stereo
* water heater can be added only to a bathroom (no restriction on quantity)

if any of the rules are violated an elert with the relevant error will pop.
Each device can eather be on or off.

## Special additions

* A custom made (by me) component working as a color picker.
* Responsive for desktop mobile and tablet.
* No graphic library was used, all the styling was done using CSS alone.
